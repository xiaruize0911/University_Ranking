The university has the largest endowment of any school in the world. Harvard research takes place across a range of disciplines in more than 100 centers.\n\n The university is made up of the undergraduate college, as well as 11 other degree-granting institutions including the highly ranked Business School, Graduate School of Education, Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. The medical school is affiliated with several teaching hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. For Harvard undergraduates, the most popular majors include social sciences, biology/biological sciences, history, math and psychology. The university\u2019s academic calendar is semester-based and English is the language of instruction. Most undergraduate students live on campus for all four years, first residing around the Harvard Yard at the center of campus as freshmen and then in one of 12 undergraduate houses for the duration of their studies. Some university housing is available for graduate students. The Harvard Library is the largest academic library in the world, boasting around 19 million volumes at its more than 70 libraries."

The university is divided into 14 colleges and schools, including the highly ranked Haas School of Business, College of Chemistry, College of Engineering, School of Public Health and School of Law. The academic calendar is semester-based and English is the language of instruction.\n\n UC\u2014Berkeley offers students around 350 degree programs. Some of the most popular majors for Berkeley undergraduates have included electrical engineering and computer science; economics; political science; business administration; and psychology. Around a quarter of undergraduate students live on campus, including some 95 percent of freshmen. Many graduate students live off campus, but they have the option to live in university-owned accommodations. Roughly 15 percent of the student body is international, and tuition and fees are higher for out-of-state students. Around 3,000 international scholars come to Berkeley each year in temporary teaching or research positions. Berkeley research is conducted not just within academic department labs and research centers but also in some of the school\u2019s museums and university-managed biological field stations. Research in botany, zoology, ecosystems and forestry is undertaken at the remote field station sites. Berkeley researchers discovered several of the elements on the periodic table, including californium and berkelium."

UCL is based in central London, though it also has branch campuses in Qatar and Australia. Additionally, UCL has exchange and research agreements as well as other types of partnerships with universities around the world, such as the University of Montreal in Canada and Zhejiang University in China. UCL students hail from around 150 countries, and tuition costs are higher for students from outside the U.K. and European Union. University housing is guaranteed for first-year undergraduates. The UCL academic calendar has three terms, and the language of instruction is English.\n\nUCL has 11 academic divisions: arts and humanities; brain sciences; engineering; education; laws; life sciences; mathematical and physical sciences; medical sciences; population health sciences; social and historical sciences; and the Bartlett, a division focused on architecture and planning. The university is affiliated with several hospitals and medical centers, such as the University College Hospital and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Research takes place across the academic disciplines at UCL, but the main multidisciplinary research domains are neuroscience, personalized medicine, populations and lifelong health, the environment and eResearch. The university has been associated with research accomplishments throughout its history. One example is that a UCL professor won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1904 for his discovery of noble gases, including neon gas."
