MIT contains five schools: architecture and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; and science. English is the language of instruction at MIT. The academic calendar is a 4-1-4 system with a four-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in January. During this period, undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff and alumni participate in forums, lecture series, recitals and other special activities. \n\n First-year undergraduate students are the only ones required to live on campus but many students further along in their studies choose to reside on campus as well. There are many opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to gain research experience at one of MIT\u2019s many labs or centers, including the MIT Nuclear Reactor Laboratory, one of the largest university research reactors in the U.S. Nearly 90 percent of MIT undergraduates participate in the school\u2019s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, which partners students and faculty for research projects, by the time they graduate. More than $675 million was spent on research at MIT in a recent year, with additional federal funding going to MIT\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory, a Department of Defense research and development lab focused on technological solutions to national security issues."

Oxford is located around 60 miles northwest of London, and around 45 percent of its student body is made up of graduate students. More than half of Oxford\u2019s graduate students conduct research as part of their studies. Research at Oxford takes place in all four of its academic divisions: humanities; mathematical, physical and life sciences; medical sciences; and social sciences. Oxford\u2019s academic calendar is divided into three terms \u2013 Michaelmas (fall), Hilary (spring) and Trinity (summer) \u2013 each eight weeks long. The language of instruction at the university is English.\n\n The University of Oxford is made up of a central university; 38 colleges; and six Permanent Private Halls, which tend to be smaller than colleges and offer fewer subjects. The colleges at Oxford are each equipped with a dining hall, common room and library. Undergraduates are guaranteed college housing for their freshman year and can often continue to live there during the later years of their studies. Graduate students are not guaranteed housing but some colleges may have space for them during their first year, especially for international students. Tuition costs are higher for non-European Union students. The university and its academic departments and colleges, as well as dozens of external organizations, have made more than 900 scholarships available for graduate students."

Dozens of academic departments and other divisions constitute these schools. The academic calendar at Cambridge is divided into three terms \u2013 Michaelmas (fall), Lent (winter) and Easter (spring). English is the language of instruction at the university.\n\n Cambridge contains 31 residential colleges, which are responsible for admitting undergraduate and graduate students; three colleges \u2013 Lucy Cavendish College, Murray Edwards College and Newnham College \u2013 are women-only. Some small-group instruction for undergraduates also takes place at the colleges. Most undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge are guaranteed college housing for at least three years. Many new graduate students can also utilize college housing. Around 20 percent of the student body is from outside of the European Union; tuition costs are higher for non-EU students and vary depending on the field of study. Cambridge has more than 100 libraries, including college and department libraries. The university has around 140 centers and institutes that contribute to different areas of research, such as the Centre of African Studies; the Cambridge Centre for Economic and Public Policy; and the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics. In a recent year, the university received around $415 million in research grants and contracts."

            "Description": "The University of California\u2014Berkeley is situated roughly 15 miles from San Francisco in what is known as the Bay Area. The public university, also commonly known as Berkeley or Cal, was founded in 1868. More than 70 percent of Berkeley students study at the undergraduate level. The university is divided into 14 colleges and schools, including the highly ranked Haas School of Business, College of Chemistry, College of Engineering, School of Public Health and School of Law. The academic calendar is semester-based and English is the language of instruction.\n\n UC\u2014Berkeley offers students around 350 degree programs. Some of the most popular majors for Berkeley undergraduates have included electrical engineering and computer science; economics; political science; business administration; and psychology. Around a quarter of undergraduate students live on campus, including some 95 percent of freshmen. Many graduate students live off campus, but they have the option to live in university-owned accommodations. Roughly 15 percent of the student body is international, and tuition and fees are higher for out-of-state students. Around 3,000 international scholars come to Berkeley each year in temporary teaching or research positions. Berkeley research is conducted not just within academic department labs and research centers but also in some of the school\u2019s museums and university-managed biological field stations. Research in botany, zoology, ecosystems and forestry is undertaken at the remote field station sites. Berkeley researchers discovered several of the elements on the periodic table, including californium and berkelium."

It was the third university established in England, following the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. UCL is based in central London, though it also has branch campuses in Qatar and Australia. Additionally, UCL has exchange and research agreements as well as other types of partnerships with universities around the world, such as the University of Montreal in Canada and Zhejiang University in China. UCL students hail from around 150 countries, and tuition costs are higher for students from outside the U.K. and European Union. University housing is guaranteed for first-year undergraduates. The UCL academic calendar has three terms, and the language of instruction is English.\n\nUCL has 11 academic divisions: arts and humanities; brain sciences; engineering; education; laws; life sciences; mathematical and physical sciences; medical sciences; population health sciences; social and historical sciences; and the Bartlett, a division focused on architecture and planning. The university is affiliated with several hospitals and medical centers, such as the University College Hospital and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Research takes place across the academic disciplines at UCL, but the main multidisciplinary research domains are neuroscience, personalized medicine, populations and lifelong health, the environment and eResearch. The university has been associated with research accomplishments throughout its history. One example is that a UCL professor won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1904 for his discovery of noble gases, including neon gas."

Tuition costs are higher for non-Washington-state residents, and university housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. UW utilizes a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the language of instruction. \n\nThe university has 16\u00a0colleges and schools that offer studies in a range of subjects, such as arts and sciences, engineering and social work. Its highly ranked graduate schools include the School of Medicine, School of Nursing and the College of Education. The University of Washington Medical Center, a teaching hospital, is highly ranked in several specialties. The university offers a community-based medical education program that allows students to complete clinical rotations in different states throughout the region - Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Washington and Wyoming. One goal of the program is to increase the number of primary care physicians, particularly in rural areas. Research awards received by UW\u00a0have topped $1 billion in\u00a0recent years, and the school has more than 280 specialized research centers. Among these research centers are the West Coast Poverty Center, the Polar Science Center and the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases."

Students who are not California residents must pay a supplemental tuition. UCLA guarantees three years of housing to freshman undergraduates, and some university housing is available for graduate students as well.\n\n Undergraduate studies take place across five academic divisions at UCLA: letters and science; arts and architecture; engineering and applied science; nursing; and theater, film and television. Some of the most popular majors for undergraduate students are political science, business economics and biology. Among the university\u2019s highly ranked graduate schools are the Anderson School of Management, the David Geffen School of Medicine and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, the university\u2019s primary teaching hospital, is a highly regarded medical facility. Most of the university\u2019s schools use a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the language of instruction. Since 2009-2010, the university has received an average of $1 billion for research each year. UCLA has more than 350 research labs, centers and institutes, and nearly 300 of these facilities are dedicated to medical research. Undergraduates can assist faculty with research at UCLA \u2013 and earn academic credit \u2013 by participating in the Student Research Program.\n"

The school has campuses located in and around Baltimore and the District of Columbia, as well as in Italy and China. The main campus for undergraduates is the Homewood campus in north Baltimore. Most of the university\u2019s schools use a semester-based academic calendar, with some offering an additional, three-week study period in January. English is the language of instruction. Undergraduate students are required to live in university housing for the first two years of their studies. Accommodations are not available for graduate students, with the exception of those enrolled in the school's Peabody Institute, a conservatory.\n\nThe university comprises nine academic divisions that offer studies in the arts and sciences, engineering, business, education, medicine, nursing, music, public health and international studies. Some of the most popular majors for undergraduates (at the Homewood campus) are public health studies, international studies and biomedical engineering. Johns Hopkins University\u2019s graduate schools include the highly ranked School of Medicine, School of Nursing and School of Education. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, a teaching hospital, is highly ranked in many specialties.\u00a0Undergraduate students can get involved in research with support from initiatives such as the Provost\u2019s Undergraduate Research Awards program, which provides financing for students to design and conduct research with the help of a faculty sponsor. Among the institution's research facilities is the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, an affiliated research center that is a hub for national security- and space-related research."

The private, Ivy League institution is located in West Philadelphia, and nearly half of its full-time students study at the undergraduate level. Around 19 percent of the total student body is international, with students from more than 100 countries. In a recent year, more than 40 percent of Penn's international undergraduates hailed from Asia, 20 percent were from Europe and nearly 15 percent were from Canada and Mexico. The university uses a semester-based academic calendar and the language of instruction is English. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus and may continue to do so as upperclassmen, although housing is not guaranteed after the first year. Some on-campus housing is available for graduate students as well.\n\nPenn comprises a dozen schools that focus on arts and sciences; business; communication; dental medicine; design; education; engineering and applied science; law; medicine; nursing; social policy and practice; and veterinary medicine. Four of the schools offer undergraduate degrees and all 12 have graduate offerings. The medical school is affiliated with the Hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian, which are highly ranked in several specialties. Penn\u2019s research budget was more than $875 million in a recent year. The university\u2019s Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships helps students find research projects that suit their interests, as well as funding resources. Among the university\u2019s more than 130 research institutes and centers are the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and the Penn Institute for Urban Research."

The university is located in the town of Princeton, New Jersey, situated around 50 miles southwest of New York City. Some 8,000 students attend Princeton and nearly two-thirds of them study at the undergraduate level. Around 12 percent of undergraduates and more than 40 percent of graduate students at Princeton are international. Housing is guaranteed for undergraduate students for all four years, and nearly all undergraduates reside on campus. Princeton has six undergraduate residential colleges \u2013 communities that offer academic and social programs for students. A large number of graduate students, around 70 percent, also live in university housing.\n\nThe Ivy League university is made up of an undergraduate college, a graduate school, the School of Architecture, the highly ranked School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Princeton undergrads can choose from more than 30 academic concentrations. The primary language of instruction is English, and the academic calendar is semester-based. Research at Princeton is conducted across four broad disciplines: engineering and applied sciences, humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. The university is affiliated with two national laboratories, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. The latter lab specializes in climate research and modeling."

Roughly 95 percent of the university\u2019s graduate students study at the downtown St. George campus, as do upward of 60 percent of its undergraduates. Thousands of foreign students from more than 160 countries and regions attend the University of Toronto. In a recent year, the top countries of origin for non-Canadian students were China, India and the U.S. Tuition is higher for international students. \n\nThe university comprises academic divisions focused on a range of disciplines, such as applied science and engineering, management and public health. All told, the university offers some 700 undergraduate programs and more than 200 master\u2019s and doctoral programs. The primary language of instruction is English. The academic calendar varies between the three campuses. Student housing is available on each campus, and accommodations are guaranteed for all first-year undergraduate students. The university has more than 44 libraries that house 19 million-plus physical volumes. One major innovation that came out of the University of Toronto is insulin, which researchers discovered in the early 1920s. The university\u2019s Banting & Best Diabetes Centre is named after two of these researchers, one of whom eventually went on to win the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work."

            "Description": "The California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, was founded in 1891 as Throop University and received its current name in 1920. The science and engineering-focused school is located in Pasadena, California, roughly 11 miles northeast of Los Angeles. There are roughly 2,200 students at Caltech, with around 55 percent of them studying at the graduate level. The student-faculty ratio is very low, at 3:1. More than one-fourth of Caltech's total enrollment is international. The school\u2019s academic calendar is based on the quarter system and English is the language of instruction.\n\n Caltech has six academic divisions, many of which have highly ranked graduate programs: biology and biological engineering; chemistry and chemical engineering; engineering and applied science; geology and planetary sciences; humanities and social sciences; and physics, mathematics and astronomy. The university guarantees housing for all first-year undergraduate and graduate students. Instead of typical undergraduate residence halls like those found at many U.S. universities, there are eight undergraduate houses, each with its own government and special traditions. Newly admitted graduate students are given priority for housing in the on-campus Catalina Apartments. \n\n Around 80 percent of undergraduates participate in research during their time at Caltech. The university offers a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships program where students write research proposals, collaborate with mentors and give presentations on their projects. Caltech has around 50 research institutes and centers, such as the Resnick Sustainability Institute and the Tectonics Observatory. Additionally, the university operates NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a center for robotic exploration of the solar system that engages both faculty and students."

Duke\u2019s main location is made up of three contiguous campuses (called East, West and Central) located in Durham, North Carolina. Around 15,000 students attend the university, and more than half of them study at the graduate level. English is the language of instruction. Around 10 percent of undergraduates and nearly a quarter of graduate students are international. Undergraduates are required to live on campus for three years and can also choose to do so during their senior year. On-campus housing is not available for graduate students.\n\nDuke comprises 10 schools and colleges: arts and sciences, law, medicine, nursing, engineering, business, public policy, environment, the divinity school and the graduate school. Some of the most popular undergraduate majors are biology, economics and public policy. Most of the schools at the university use a semester-based academic calendar. Among Duke\u2019s highly ranked graduate programs are the Fuqua School of Business, School of Medicine and the School of Nursing. Duke University Hospital, a teaching hospital, is highly ranked in many specialties. In a recent year, Duke spent more than $1 billion on research, which is organized and conducted across the university at institutes such as the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, the Duke Global Health Institute and the Duke Population Research Institute. Internationally, Duke has partnered with Wuhan University to create Duke Kunshan University in China \u2013 which offers graduate degrees and semesterlong programs for undergrads \u2013 and with the National University of Singapore to create the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore."

Other sites are the Southbank, Burnley, Creswick, Dookie, Shepparton and Werribee campuses. Tuition costs at the University of Melbourne vary by subject and\u00a0are higher for international students.\u00a0Dentistry, veterinary science and medicine are among the university's more expensive programs.\n\nUndergraduate students at the University of Melbourne\u00a0choose from several bachelor's degree options: agriculture, arts, biomedicine, commerce, design, environments, fine arts, music, oral health and science. They then choose more specific\u00a0majors within these broad degree categories. Extended Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs\u00a0are also available for indigenous students. The University of Melbourne also has nearly 20 graduate schools, including the Melbourne Business School, the Melbourne Medical School and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music.\u00a0The university has five Melbourne Research Institutes that encourage collaboration between university researchers, as well as involvement from\u00a0industry, government and nonprofit\u00a0organizations. The institutes focus on\u00a0neuroscience, sustainable society, networked society, energy and social equity. One research achievement associated with the University of Melbourne came in the 1970s, when researchers developed the cochlear implant, an electronic device used to restore a sense of sound\u00a0to people with severe hearing loss."
